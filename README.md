## About

This site is my own companies site. It's christmas light install service that has been around for a couple years that deals with real clients. 
Currently its just a font end project with a few features for client interaction - emails directed to me for quotes and reviews.
Since it is a seasonal job for the winter months, this is verson 1.0 with a lot more development to work on.

## Future development
* server side that can include a way to track all repeating clients and creating a new client
* way to track expenses and mileage used
* scheduling application
* send out invoices and collect payments.

## Technologies used
* Reactjs
* Bootstrap react
* @emailjs/browser
